Full Requirements Specification (MVP)
1. Product Scope

A mobile-first web SaaS built with:

Next.js (App Router)

React

Tailwind CSS

shadcn/ui

Auth.js (NextAuth) with Google login

PostgreSQL + Prisma

Audience: initially you; later paid SaaS for men 40+.

Core focus:

Golf swing speed (primary)

Strength training with progressive overload (secondary)

2. Authentication & SaaS Foundation
Auth

Google login (Auth.js)

Persistent accounts

Data tied to user ID

SaaS readiness

subscription_status field (trial default)

No billing implementation yet

Multi-user ready

Future support: teams, coaches, friends

3. Golf Module (SuperSpeed Level 1)
3.1 Session Structure

Guided protocol in this exact order:

Block 1 – NORMAL

Light (D, ND)

Medium (D, ND)

Heavy (D, ND)

Block 2 – STEP

Light (D, ND)

Medium (D, ND)

Heavy (D, ND)

Block 3 – MAX NORMAL

Light (D only)

Block 4 – DRIVER

Driver Max (D only)

Total possible entries per session: 15

3.2 Input Rules

Manual entry only

Numeric keypad with “.” button

Speeds stored as 1 decimal max

Range: 0.0–999.9 mph

Stored internally as tenths integer

Skip allowed per item

Session may be saved if at least one value exists

3.3 Guided Flow Behavior

Shows current block header

Shows “Next item”

Shows progress indicator (e.g., 5/15)

After saving a value:

User must press Start 60s Rest

Countdown runs

End triggers sound + vibration (in-app only)

Auto-advance to next item

3.4 Dashboard Golf Metrics

Primary metrics:

1. Driver Max (Dominant)

All-time PR

Best of last 7 sessions (that include driver)

Show “Last 7 = X days”

2. Light Normal (Dominant)

Same logic as above

Only these two metrics matter for PR highlighting.

3.5 PR Logic

All-time max across all sessions

Last-7 best = max across most recent 7 sessions containing that metric

Span days = difference between oldest and newest in last-7 set

4. Strength Module
4.1 Routine Structure

Users define:

Sessions per week (default 3)

Editable day labels (A, B, C)

Sequential cycling:

A → B → C → A

Independent of calendar

User may override day selection manually

Missed sessions roll forward.

4.2 Exercise Library

Built-in default exercise list

Users may create custom exercises

Users can add multiple exercises per day

Exercises reorderable

4.3 Logging Structure

Per exercise:

3 sets

Each set: weight + reps

Optional notes

Weights:

Allow decimals

Store internally in kg

Default display unit: lb

User can toggle lb/kg

4.4 Progressive Overload Rule

Double progression:

If last completed session for exercise was:

3 sets

All reps ≥ 12

Then:

Suggest next weight = last weight + increment

Otherwise:

Suggest same weight

No auto-deload.

4.5 Increment Rules

Defaults:

+5 lb

+2.5 kg

User adjustable in Settings:

increment_lb

increment_kg

5. Settings

Unit toggle: lb / kg

Increment lb input

Increment kg input

Timer sound toggle

Timer vibration toggle

6. UI/UX Requirements
Mobile-first

Large typography

Minimal clutter

One primary action per screen

Numeric keypad for golf

Navigation

Dashboard

Strength

Settings

7. Data Model Requirements

8. Non-Goals (Explicitly Not Included in MVP)

No 1RM calculations

No auto-deload

No coaching logic beyond progression

No push notifications

No billing implementation

No advanced analytics

No wearables integration

No ball speed tracking

9. Future-Ready Architecture (Deferred)

Teams

Coaches

Public profiles

Stripe billing

Advanced correlations (squat vs driver)

Charts & analytics expansion

Additional SuperSpeed protocols

10. Behavioral Assumptions

Speed sessions: ~3/week

Strength sessions: ~3/week

Target audience: men 40+

Performance-first positioning
